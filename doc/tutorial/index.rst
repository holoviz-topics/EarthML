EarthML Tutorial
****************

The EarthML tutorial takes you through the various stages involved in using Python open-source tools to work with machine-learning and related data analysis tools for climate and other Earth science topics:

* `Introduction and Workflow <01_Introduction_and_Workflow.html>`_: Overview of the recommended workflow.

* `Data Ingestion with Intake <02_Data_Ingestion_with_Intake.html>`_: Loading large data sets efficiently with `intake <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/intake>`_.

* `Alignment and Preprocessing <03_Alignment_and_Preprocessing.html>`_: How to prepare your data for the machine learning pipeline.

* `Resampling <04_Resampling.html>`_: How to resample large datasets.

* `Machine Learning <05_Machine_Learning.html>`_: Specifying a `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_ pipeline to ingest the prepared training data.

* `Data Visualization <06_Data_Visualization.html>`_: How to visualize your data throughout the workflow, starting from data ingestion to the final machine learning product.
