**Machine learning and visualization in Python for Earth science**

EarthML is an `open-source
<https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_ Python
library for exploratory machine learning research in Earth science.

We recommend the `Getting Started Guide <getting_started>`_ to learn
the basic concepts and start using Project as quickly as possible.

The `User Guide <user_guide>`_ goes into key concepts more deeply when
you are ready for further study.

The `API <Reference_Manual>`_ is the definitive guide to each EarthML
object.

Please feel free to report `issues
<https://github.com/pyviz-topics/EarthML/issues>`_ or `contribute code
