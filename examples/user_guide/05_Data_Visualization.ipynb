Use of the appropriate visualizations can help ensure that your raw data has been processed correctly (as detailed in the [Alignment_and_Preprocessing](./03_Alignment_and_Preprocessing.ipynb) user guide) and that the machine learning pipeline is resulting in the expected output (as described in the [Machine_Learning](./04_Machine_Learning.ipynb) user guide)."
