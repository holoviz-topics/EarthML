Essentially, we'll be creating a bag of pixels out of each image, where each pixel has multiple features (bands), but the ordering of the pixels is no longer relevant.  In this case we start with an array that is n_bands by n_y by n_x  (6, 300, 300) and we need to reshape to an array that is `(n_samples, n_features)` (9e4, 6).
